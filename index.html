 <h2> Who am I? </h2>

 <article> 
 <p><img src="picture_of_me_for_article.jpg" class="img2" alt=Dravon Anderson" width="150" height="150">I am a humble,obsequious and intellectual human being. I have had a passion for fixing and using electronic devices from a tender age, it has never decline ever since. I live by a few philosophies including: With God nothing is impossible, Where there is life there is hope and Pain is just an imagination. My hobbies include inevitably fixing broken or malfunctioning computers and electronic devices, playing all sports as I am multitalented and adding new data to my archive of a brain.I use to attend insititutions such as St.Francis Primary and Infant School, Jamaica College and The Cedar Grove Academy before embarking on my current path at The University of Mona. I'm currently enrolled to achieve a Bsc in Information Technology.</p> <p> I am interested in web development because it helps me to unleash my creative intuition. Further more the fact that web development is a constantly evolving it makes way for newer experiences and essentially fresh ideas to be put forward which can cotnribute to the diversity in web tools.The year 2020 has been a disasterous one and I hope every one sees it through. I would add more but lets not give it(2020) any more ideas.</p>

 <h2> A student's opinion on Online Learning</h2>
 <p3>October 2, 2020 by Dravon Anderson </p3>
 <article>
 <p><img src="student_struggle.jpg" class="img3" alt=Dravon Anderson" width="150" height="150">School has been tough. Transferring to all online learning has been the biggest challenge this year for me. As a student, I'd say I've usually kept up with all my work for all my classes. The biggest change I've seen in myself is becoming less focused with my school work. Being in a physical classroom is tremendously different from learning online. In a classroom, most of your focus is there, unlike virtually, the temptations are REAL! Yes, self-discipline is good to learn, but when having all this thrown at you, you can't blame the student for not wanting to work... at least that's my opinion.</p> <p>This online learning has affected me personally because during this time, I found myself turning in assignments weeks late. It wasn't because I was having trouble, it was because I had no motivation and energy to do them. This isn't the norm for me. Without a routine schedule, I felt lost. That makes me sound like a robot, but I think it's because it's been that way since we were so small, change this big is affecting me to the max. </p>
